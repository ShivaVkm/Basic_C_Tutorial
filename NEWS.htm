<h2>How is the World Powered by C?</h2>
<p>Despite the prevalence of higher-level languages, C continues to empower the world. The following are some of the systems that are used by millions and are programmed in the C language.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>
<p>Microsoft's Windows kernel is developed mostly in C, with some parts in assembly language. For decades, the world’s most used operating system, with about 90 percent of the market share, has been powered by a kernel written in C.<p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Linux is also written mostly in C, with some parts in assembly. About 97 percent of the world’s 500 most powerful supercomputers run the Linux kernel. It is also used in many personal computers.</p>
<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>Mac computers are also powered by C, since the OS X kernel is written mostly in C. Every program and driver in a Mac, as in Windows and Linux computers, is running on a C-powered kernel.</p>
<h3>Mobile</h3>
<p>iOS, Android and Windows Phone kernels are also written in C. They are just mobile adaptations of existing Mac OS, Linux and Windows kernels. So smartphones you use every day are running on a C kernel.
</p>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>The world's most popular databases, including Oracle Database, MySQL, MS SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, are coded in C (the first three of them actually both in C and C++).</p>
<p>Databases are used in all kind of systems: financial, government, media, entertainment, telecommunications, health, education, retail, social networks, web, and the like.
